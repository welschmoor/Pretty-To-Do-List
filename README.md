# Pretty-To-Do-List
My first ToDo List (gotta do one of those!), turned out to be so easy.

No Bootstrap. HTML, CSS and vJS. Will add dark/light mode switch later. The only thing I don't like when it comes to style is the tile takes away too much attention. Other than that, it's a clean looking interface. Font Arial.
